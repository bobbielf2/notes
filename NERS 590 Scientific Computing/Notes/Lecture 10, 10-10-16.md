# Lecture 10, Object Oriented Programming and Design

## Overview of Object Oriented Programming


## OO Concepts
### Encapsulation

* Encapsulation means to *hide data*
* eliminating global variables
* data is only passed through intefaces
* Advantage: can *change the low-level design* without having to update "client code"
* Disadvantage: *argument lists* for interfaces can be long
* Common practice: implement "accessor" functions (e.g. `set`, `get`)

### Inheritance

* Inheritance is a *type of relationship between classes*
* Defines a parent-chiild relationship (child class has attributes and methods of parent class)
* It's one way of code reuse
* Can have single or multiple inheritance 
    * Not all languages (e.g. Fortran) support multiple inheritance
* Facilitates *polymorphism* and *generalization* of client code

### Polymorphism

* Polymorphism means *to change behavior or representation*
* Facilitates extensibility and inheritance hierarchies
* Lets clients make fewer assumptions about dependent objects
    * decouples objects lets them vary relationshiips at run time
* Several types of polymorphism
    * static - happens at compile-time (lower overhead)
    * dynamic - happens at run-time (more flexibility)
* Example: Numerical interation (same task, many quadrature rules to choose)

### Classes, Attributes, and Methods

* In object oriented programming, objects are typically referred to or implemented as *classes*
* A *class* is a collection of *attributes* and *methods*
    * attributes are data (or variables)
    * methods are operations (or procedures)
* Good OO design:
    * attributes are typically private or only used by the object itself
    * methods are typically public and other code interactsâ€¨with the object through its methods
* What is it? (answer is attributes)
* How to use? (answer is methods)

### Overloading

* operator overloading (extra operations for the same operator)
* function overloading (same function name, different outputs)

### Abstract vs. Concrete Objects

* *Abstract objects* may have incomplete definitions
* *Abstract methods* have no defined implementation (e.g. low-level design)
    * Just an interface definition
* Abstract methods can only be defined on abstract objects
* *Abstact types* can be used to define requirements of concrete types

## The Unified Modeling Language

### UML Overview

* UML is a family of graphical notations
    * Help in describing software systems, particularly object oriented system
    * A "meta"-language: a language that describes languages (including itself!)
* Defined by a standard (OMGUML)

### Classes (nouns)

* Attributes (variables, format: `visibility name : type multiplicity = default`)
* Methods (procedures, format: `visibility name (parameter-list) : return type`)
* Abstract: no specific implementation
* Static: doesn't change
* visibility: public, protected, private
* stereotyping
* *Package diagram*

### Associations (verbs)
* Aggregation
* Composition

### UML Diagram

* Package diagram
* Class diagram (structures)
* Sequence diagram (behavior of system)
* Other types of UML Diagram
    * Object diagram
    * Package diagram
    * State diagram
    * Use case diagram
    * Activity diagrams (flow-chart, describe procedural logic work flow)
    * Deployment diagrams
    * Communication diagram

## Design Patterns

* *Design patterns* are common design solutions
* Key: understanding your design problem and being aware of patterns

### Types of patterns

* Abstract factory pattern
* Adapter pattern ("wrapper")
* Composite pattern (In scientific computing: useful for representing geometry/mesh)
* Behavioral patterns
    * State pattern (allow an object to alter behavior when internal state changes)
        * Example: Output 
            * control verbosity
            * edit to a file
            * edit to standard out
    * Strategy pattern (define a family of algorithms that are encapsulated and interchangeable)
        * Example: Linear solvers
            * if small, direct solve
            * if large, iterative solve
            * if sparse, Krylov

## Sparse Linear Algebra

* Many kinds of sparse matrix *storage format*
    * Sparse Matrix Storage Formats: 
        * COOrdinate Storage
        * Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) Storage (row and column indices)
        * ELLPACK Storage

### Creational Pattern (Builder)

* `InitializeToDefault(n)`
* `BuildMatrix` - Changes state, allows values to be set
* `BuildUpCoefficients(i,j,a_ij)` -  store as COO format
* AssembleStorage() - converts to format suitable for solvers
* GetMatrix() - return the matrix object
