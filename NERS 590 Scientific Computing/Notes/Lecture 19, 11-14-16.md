#### Doxygen: generateing documentation from annotated source code

* can generate online documentation (HTML) or off-line reference manual (LaTeX) from a set of documented source files.
* can **configure** doxygen to extract the code structure from undocumented source files
* can also create normal documentation

1. download install Doxygen
2. example for demo: download METIS-5.1.0 code
3. in Doxygen, configure in **Wizard tab**:
    * Project: METIS-5.1.0
    * Mode: All entities, include source-code
    * Output: plain HTML, with search function
    * Diagrams: no diagram
    * confirm
4. in **Run tab**, hit "run doxygen" (then compile for a bit)
5. hit "show HTML output"

##### make it more interesting

* Project: METIS-5.1.0
* Mode: All entities, include source-code
* Output: **with navigation panel**
* Diagrams: **use dot tool from Graphviz Package**, call graphs (can be downloaded from Graphviz.org)
* confirm

## Modeling and verification/validation

Steps

1. Creating input (model)
2. Testing the model
3. run model
4. post-processing and analysis (back to step 1 or 2 and iterate)

Advice

1. don't expect to get the right answer on the first try
2. don't expect to simulate the model once
3. script your post-processing analysis
