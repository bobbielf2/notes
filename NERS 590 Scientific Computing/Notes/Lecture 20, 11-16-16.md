## Meshing

* Laplace equation, Dirichlet problem
* Discretization methods: FDM, FEM
* $\Omega$ discretize as $\Omega_h$ (the **grid**/**mesh**)
    * Example: a mesh for the Mobius strip (surface with only one face)
    * Example simulations (only possible with good meshing)
        * bacteria
        * charge/discharge liquid crystal
        * morphology: pathern on the skin

### What is a mesh

two data structures:

1. collection of nodes (stencil points)
    * The **nodes** $\{1,2,\ldots,9\}$
    * The **coordinates of the nodes** given by a $9\times n$ matrix, where $n$ is the dimension of the problem
2. nodes and elements (for FEM)
    * **nodes** (vertices) $\{1,2,\ldots,9\}$ and **elements** (faces of the graph) $\{1,2,3,4\}$
    * The **coordinates of the nodes** given by a $9\times n$ matrix, and the **connectivity map** that discribes the nodes of each element $4\times k$ matrix, suppose each element is a $k$-gon

* In real world problems, 90% of cost (money) goes to generating the mesh.

### Characteristics of meshes

* meshes in many **dimensions**
* how **fine** the mesh is determined by the physics (e.g. CFD multiple scales in turbulent flow)
* **adaptive** meshes (depending on regions of interest)
* same set of nodes can have many different sets of elements (**tensor-grid** vs **simplex**)

### Mesh generating softwares

* **Cubit**
    * written in *python script*
    * *mesh type*: tet (tetrahedon) or hex (cubes)
    * mapping schemes (e.g. space-filling curves)
    * mesh size
    * mesh volume
    * quality of mesh
* create the geometry (**or** import from *CAD file*)
    * sweep a spline to generate a surface, sweep a surface to generate a volume
    * **boolean operations** to generate geometry

### Mesh file formats

* ucd (gmsh)
* vtk, vtu, vts, ... (gmsh, python, libmesh, tetgen)
* exodus (Cubit)
* Abaqus, Nastran, Hypermesh
* `.inp` file (UCD format)

```
27 8 0 0 0  // (27 nodes, 8 elements, three coordinates)
1   (3 coordinates)
2   (3 coordinates)
...   
27  (3 coordinates) 
1 0 hex (8 nodes)
2 0 hex (8 nodes)
...   
8 0 hex (8 nodes)
```


* `.vtk` data file

```
POINTS 8 float

CELLS 6 24

CELL_TYPES 6

### Re-meshing

* one mesh initially
* solution at different time steps
* mesh may deform over time
* Example: a red-blood cell (RBC) moving and deforming (tank-treading), if the RBC breaks at some timestep, export the geometry and ask cubit to **re-mesh**, then continue with the new mesh. **can I have that movie?**
