#### About direct solvers

- FDM or FEM methods alone can't get arbitrary high accuracy because as the grid is refined, the condition number of the discrete operator grows without bound
- Condition number determines both *convergence rate* and *numercial stability*


#### Multigrid method

- Residual correction
    - the residual problem is easier to solve than the original problem (solve in a coarser grid)
- Smoother
    - kills high-frequency first (e.g. weighted Jacobi)
    - Conjegate gradient (CG) is *not* a smoother, so unsuitable for successive refinements
- In the coarsest grid, solve the problem exactly using direct solvers
