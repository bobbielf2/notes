###

* OpenMP is a *directive-based* API that supports multi-platform *shared memory multiprocessing* programming
* OpenMP implementations
    * broad supporting compilers <http://openmp.org/wp/openmp-compilers/>
* OpenMP programming
    1. Start with serial code
    2. Identify the parallelism it contains
    3. Incrementally express the parallelism using OpenMP constructs

    * When that does not give good enough performance
        * thread-specific programming
* OpenMP functions
    * The number of threads available to the process: `omp_get_max_threads()`
    * The number of threads currently using: `omp_get_num_threads()`
    * Generally we want #threads = #cores
* Parallel constructs
    * Parallel regions
    
    ```c
    #pragma omp parallel
    {
        block
    }
    ```
    
    * Parallel for
    
    ```c
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for(...){
        block
    }
    ```
    
* Problem: shared variables    

    ```c
    #pragma omp parallel for private (i,j,temp)
    for( i=0; i<n; i++){
        for( j=0; j<n; j++){
            temp = a[i][j];
            a[i][j] = b[i][j];
            b[i][j] = temp;
        }
    }
    ```
    
    * other data sharing clauses
        * `shared(i)`: $i$ inside #pragma is shared and everybody access the same $i$
        * `firstprivate(i)`: $i$ inside #pragma is private and has initial value *the same as before entering `#pragma`*
        * `lastprivate(i)`: $i$ inside `#pragma` is private; after exiting `#pragma omp for` $i$ has the same value as the private copy $i$ of *the thread executed the final loop*.
* Loop scheduling
    * Static - equal-sized chunks of iterations are assigned to each thread. When done, it waits for the others
    * Dynamic - threads obtain a new chunk when their current chunk is finished (default chunk size is 1, this option has overhead)
    * Guided (most complicated) - chunk size starts off large and decreases, for better load balancing
    * Auto - let the compiler choose
    * Runtime - the OMP_SCHEDULE environment variable determines the scheduling strategy
