#### History of C/C++

- C - started 1969 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs
    - most widely used PL
    - related to Unix operating system
- C++ - also developed at Bell Labs, starting 1979
- C/C++ standard library
    - **Huge advantage** over Fortran
- Templating
    - **very powerful** feature (in C++ only) Idea is like meta-programming
    - write a program for a "template" type
    - Compiler generates machine code for all data types matching the template
    - Useful links:
        - [dynamic array](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~cheung/Courses/255/Syllabus/2-C-adv-data/dyn-array.html)
        - Emory University, Shun Yan Cheung's [CS255](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~cheung/Courses/255/Syllabus/syl.html) (Look for: Chapter 12, Introduction to the (System Programming Language) C)

#### Assembly

- Low level language
- Hand written assembly can be significantly faster than C/C++/Fortran    
- Min instruction set
- Used in video games (e.g. the "engine")

#### Bash scripting

- Documentation available at [Too Long Didn't Program (tldp)](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/index.html)

#### LaTeX

- ShareLaTeX (LaTeX like "Google Drive")
- latexdiff (compare difference between latexpdf's. useful for research collaboration)

#### Python

- Similar to MATLAB in many aspects
- Free
- Data processing modules
    - numpy (can deal with larger arrays and faster)
    - scipy
    - matplotlib
- Easy to process files (can use to process grades when teaching)
