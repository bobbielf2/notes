#### Terminology about *Time*
- configure-time
- compile-time/build-time
- Link
- test

#### "Toolchain"

- Configure
- Compile
- Link
- Test
- Install

#### Configuring

- creates "Makefiles" (detailed instructions to cook)
- Specialized programs (cookbook)
- Things controled by configuring
    - where are the libraries and executables?
    - Compiler options
    - what features of library are enabled
    - other options specific to software packages
- Use *CMake* if starting new (Autotool for configuring)
- `./configure`, `cmake <options> <source_dir>`

#### Compiler

From *Source code* to *Libraries and/or Executables*: three steps done by compiler:

- Front end (parsing codes): 
    - lexical analysis (create tokens)
    - syntax analysis
    - type checking
- Middle part: 
    - intermediate coded generation
    - optimization
- Back end: 
    - register allocation
    - machine code generation
    - assembly and linking

##### compiler preprocessing

- Example 1: #define statements in C
- Example 2: #ifdef controls in Fortran

##### Compiler options:

- for debugging
    - GCC compiler: `-g` option (produce debugging info), other options are relatively unimportant.
- for optimization
    - `O0` (default) reduce compilation time
    - `O1` to `O3` (more and more optimizations)
    - `Ofast` (even more optimizations, not as stable in some systems)
    - `Og` optimizations safe for debugging
- for warnings
    - `-w` turn off all warnings
    - `-Werror` turn all warnings errors
- Many other options

##### Object code & binary output

- `source.F90` compile ouput is an object binary code `source.o`
- Inspecting object files: `readelf -a source.o`

#### Linking

**Linking** is the process of combining the various objects and libraries output from compilation into a single executable (or library or object).

- Dynamic linking vs Static linking: 
    - Static: copy all binary code from all libraries, results in larger executable file sizes, need all *static libraries*
    - Dynamic: symbol resolution is delayed until executable is run, need all *dynamic libraries*, benefit if a library updates and fixed bugs
- Troubleshoot link errors
    - dynamic: useful command `ldd`
- Dynamic loading: linking in code at run time
- Multi-language programs: *The key is linking!*
