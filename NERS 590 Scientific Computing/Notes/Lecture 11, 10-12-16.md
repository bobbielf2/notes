## Predictive Science

* Predictions are strongly subject to uncertainty

1. Real world problem (variablity & modeling assumptions, **GoTo 2**)
2. Mathematical Model (discretize, **GoTo 3**)
3. Numerical solution (**GoTo 4**)
4. Certification, QMU (numerical errors, **Go back to 3**; uncertainties, **Go back to 2**; otherwise **GoTo 5**)
5. Use

Quantifying and controlling uncertainty and errors is neccessary for certification

## Three main topics

* Validation: solving the right equtions? $\to$ modeling errors
* Verification: solving the equations right? $\to$ code & numerical errors
* Uncertainty quantification: accounting for all sources of uncertainties?

### Uncertainty Quantification (UQ)

Types of uncertainty:

* **Aleatory**: natural variablity. naturally treated in a probalistic framework (e.g. wind speed, physical structure)
* **Epistemic**: improper knowledge. not necessariliy amenable to probabilistic treatment (e.g. numerical error, modeling error)
* Identify and propagate randomness in a system
* estimate confidence in model predictions
* develop robust and reliable design solutions
* risk analysis

#### SBES
* SBES - simulation based engineering science
* Tyranny of scales
* Validation
* Verifcation

### Aleatoric Uncertainty Propagation

**Mathematical Tools:** probability, statistical tools (random variables, pdf, etc.)

#### Probabilistic Uncertainty Propagation

* perform simulations accounting for the uncertainty represented as randomness
* Two types of methodology
    * Nonintrusive methods: only require (multiple) solutions of the original model, doesn't mess with the concrete model (e.g. Monte Carlo method)
    * Intrusive method: actually go into to model an analyse

##### (Nonintrusive methods) Example: analyzing a vibrating spring

 
* Monte Carlo: Converge like $1/\sqrt{n}$
* Stochastic Collocation: Converge much faster
    * Reducing cost in multiple dimensions: *sparse grid sampling* (e.g. Smolyak)
* Polynomial Chaos methods: 
    * using **polynomial basis** for probability space (like interpolation) 
    * use least squares based solution

##### (Intrusive methods) Example: solve the Burgers equation

* *Nonintrusive*: Use random IC (initial condition) 
* *Intrusive*: PC + Stochastic Galerkin (PC expansion $\to$ substitution $\to$ project $\to$ orthogonality $\to$ blah)

## Verification

* **Code verification**: does the code give the right results (no bugs)?
    * MMS (Method of Manufatured Solutions) (skipped...)
* **Solution verification**: for a given problem, is the numerical error acceptable? 
    * **Order of accuracy test**: converge in what order
    * **Richardson Extrapolation**: A simple method to *better estimate*

## Epistemic uncertainty

* due to an **improper knowledge** of the system itself
* Hardest aspect of UQ
* Example: Deficient physics in a model

## Summary

* Aleatory (variablility) & epsitemic (lack of knowledge) 
* uncertainty

## Current research issues in UQ

* Address curse of dimensionality
* Weakly intrusive formulations
* efficient stochastic sollocation (adaptation, use of adjoints)
* Application to complex response surfaces
* application to complex multi-physics problems
* Model-form uncertainties
* Numerical error estimation
