* Stokes equation in terms of the stream function $$E^4\psi = 0$$
where the operator $E^2 = \frac{\partial}{\partial 
r^2} + \frac{\sin \theta}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\left(\frac{1}{\sin\theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\right)$

### Derivation of Stokes equation

* Reynolds number: Re$=\frac{\rho U L}{\mu}$
* Strouhal number: St$=\frac{L}{U\tau}$ (time effect in the $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}$ term)

### pressure drop

* flow past a sphere:
    * Inviscid flow: no pressure drop (Bernoulli's principle)
    * Stokes flow: there's pressure drop (has drag)
* **Stokes Law**: drag force $F_D = 6\pi\mu UR$


# Lecture 14

* Drag coefficient (scaled with inertia)
    * $C_D:= \frac{F_D}{\frac{1}{2}\rho U^2 A}$
    * $A =$ projected area of sphere $= \pi R^2$
    * So $$C_D = \frac{6\pi\mu UR}{\frac{1}{2}\rho U^2 \pi R^2} = \frac{24\mu}{\rho U (2R)} = \frac{24}{\text{Re}_D}$$ where $\text{Re}_D:=\rho UD/\mu$
* Correction to Stokes Law: Perturbation analysis
    * **Regular perturbation method:**
        * Assume Re is small but **nonzero**, then the steady-state Stokes equation is  $$\text{Re}\; u\cdot\nabla u = -\nabla p + \nabla^2 u$$
        * Assume $u = u_0 + \text{Re}\,u_1 + O(\text{Re}^2)$
    * **Caution:** the regular perturbation doesn't work! the first order term $u_1$ blows up in far-field
    * Another way: **Oseen's approximation** $$\text{Re}\;U\cdot\nabla u = -\nabla p + \nabla^2 u$$ where the nonlinear term velocity is replaced by the far-field velocity $U$
        * Oseen's correction (pronouced \Osein\ .)
          $$C_D = \frac{24}{\text{Re}_D}\qquad \text{Stokes (1851)}$$
          $$C_D = \frac{24}{\text{Re}_D}(1+\frac{3}{16}\text{Re}_D)\qquad \text{Oseen (1889)}$$
    * **Matched asymptotic expansion** (Peter Miller, Ch8)
        * JRA Pearson's solution
          $$C_D = \frac{24}{\text{Re}_D}(1+\frac{3}{16}\text{Re}_D + \frac{9}{160}\text{Re}_D^2\ln(\text{Re}))\qquad \text{Pearson & Proudman (1957)}$$

## From flow-past-sphere to point-force solution

* Sphere: fluid can "feel" the drag force $-F_D$ by the sphere, but doesn't "know" the radius $R$ of the sphere; it only "knows" the product $UR$. Both force&far-field velocity are proportional to $UR$.
* Treat $UR$ as an entity, shrink the sphere to a point, get the **Stokeslet**.
* Stokeslet: Stokes flow generated by a point force.
* Place Stokeslet on a surface, by **superposition** principle, can integrate to obtain solution to Stokes equation.

### Polymer and stretching

* Strething a filament, if it has polymers in it, it won't break as easily as it would if there hasn't.
