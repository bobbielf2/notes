## Stokes flow

* Reversibility
    * Swimmers in viscous fluid must exercise **asymmetric** strokes to move around
* Stokes equation $\nabla P = \mu\nabla^2 v$
    * Take the divergence of both sides: $\nabla^2 P = 0$
    * Take the Laplacian of both sides: $\nabla^4 v = 0$
    * Take the curl of both sides: $\nabla^2 \omega = 0$
    * $\nabla^4 \psi = 0$

### Creeping flow around a solid sphere

* Streamfunction formulation (spherical coordinate):
    * $E^2E^2\psi = 0$
