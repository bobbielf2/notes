## Lecture 1 

Fluid flows are Driven by

* Pressure gradient
* surfaces (solid and fluid)
* body forces (e.g. gravity)

Flow patterns governed by:

* Reynolds number
* Deborah number
* Weber number
* Froude number
* Strouhal number
* Capillary number
* Marangoni number

### Reynolds number

* Low Reynolds number flow: symmetric around symmetric objects
* vortex can appear in low Reynolds number
* Hele-Shaw Cell: streamline identical to inviscid flow

* "angle of attack" affects the flow: large angle induces turbulent boundary layer.
* Taylor-Couette instability
